### Howdy! 

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Garry and I'm a web developer in the making. My journey to coding began late last year when I decided to make a career change and pursue an interest that sprung from years of fiddling with computers and other tech devices. 

At the moment, my goal is to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of web development and establish an understanding of how front and back-end languages work harmoniously to present a complete user experience. Over time, I hope to expand my knowledge in programming and pick up more languages. While I aim to be well-versed in full-stack development, my objective is to focus in back-end programming.
