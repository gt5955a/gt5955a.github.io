short-description: Online music player

---
**Summary**

Bloc Jams is an online music player that offers a wide variety of music selection with unlimited streaming and no ads. It is designed to be used both on your computer and mobile devices.

**Explanation**

Bloc Jams is the first of six projects that is part of Bloc's curriculum. Through the guidance of Bloc's rubric, help from my mentor, and a variety of online resurces, I used a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes to develop a simple music player that is compatible to web browsers on different devices.

**Problem**

As a first-time developer, there were obviously many roadblocks that I encountered throughout this first (ever) project; from minor spelling and punctuation mistakes to missing lines of codes. The majority of the problems came from figuring out and writing JavaScript codes. 

**Solution**

To resolve the roadblocks that I encountered throughout the project, I used a variety of resources including guidance from my mentor and online resources (such as W3Schools and Mozilla Developer Network) to understand different syntaxes that I was not familiar with. 

**Results**

Through sweat and tears, and probably some hair loss (but not really), I eventually overcame each of the problems that I encountered. One thing I noticed is that debugging codes often helps with the learning process. 

**Conclusion**

Overall, Bloc Jams is a project that only requires simple frontend development to create. The project involves many different moving parts that are broken down into smaller sections to make it easier to develop.
